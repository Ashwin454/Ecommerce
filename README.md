Here it is the codebase of a full fledged Ecommerce app with User authentication, admin panel to every page required to make an Ecommerce website.
Technologies used:
1) MongoDB
2) ExpressJS
3) NodeJS
4) ReactJS
5) Core Javascript
6) Redux
7) Several APIs
8) REST APIs

   
I have effectively managed the codebase by implementing a modular approach, wherein each component is organized into separate files. This meticulous structuring ensures clarity and maintainability throughout the project.
